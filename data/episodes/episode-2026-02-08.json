Great job!  \n\nListen for these words in today’s story!  \n[NEWS STORY]\nEngland’s rugby team won a very big game. They played against Wales. England scored seven tries. A try is when a player touches the ball down in the other team’s area. This gives many points. Remember our word player? It means a person who plays a sport. England’s players did very well.  \n\nThe team’s shirt used to weigh heavy. Remember our word weigh? It means to find out how heavy something is. Now, the players look like they double in size. Double means two times bigger. They are stronger and faster in the shirt.  \n\nMatt Dawson is a famous player who won the World Cup before. He talked about the game. He said England’s win was very good. But he also said the coach can learn from other teams. Learn means to get knowledge or skill. The coach’s name is Steve Borthwick. A coach is a person who trains and helps the players.  \n\nMatt Dawson thinks the coach can learn lessons from France. France is another strong rugby team. England can get better if they listen to these lessons. A lesson is something important we learn, often from experience.  \n\nIn rugby, teams try to score more than the other team. England scored seven tries. This is a big number. Wales did not score many points. England won by a big number. This is called a thrashing. Thrash means to defeat someone by a big difference in the score. Remember our word thrash? It means to win very easily and by a lot.  \n\nThis kind of win shows England is strong now. The players are bigger and better in their shirts. The coach has good ideas but can still learn from others. This is how sports teams grow and improve.  \n[REVIEW]\nRemember the word weigh? It was about the shirt that used to be heavy. Now, the players look bigger. The word player means the people who play rugby in the game. England’s players scored many points. Double means two times bigger. The players look like they double in size in the shirt. Learn means to get new knowledge. The coach can learn lessons from other teams. The coach is the person who trains the players. A lesson is something important to learn. Thrash means to win by a big score. England gave Wales a big thrashing in the game.  \n[PRACTICE]\nQUESTION: How many tries did England score in the game?  \nThink about your answer.  \nANSWER: England scored seven tries in the game. Did you get it right? Great job!  \n\nQUESTION: What can the coach learn from France?  \nThink about your answer.  \nANSWER: The coach can learn lessons to help the team get better. That is correct!  \n\nQUESTION: What does the word thrash mean in the story?  \nThink about your answer.  \nANSWER: Thrash means to win by a big difference in the score. Well done!  \n[CLOSING]\nRemember my question at the beginning? The answer is seven tries. Did you guess correctly? Today, you learned five new words: weigh, player, double, learn, and coach.
