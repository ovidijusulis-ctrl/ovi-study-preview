  "transcript": "[OPENING]\nWelcome listeners to Ovi English School. Today, we have a very exciting story about a new phone technology. Imagine talking on the phone and hearing a different language translated right away! Here is a question for you: How many languages will the new phone feature translate? I will tell you the answer at the end. Remember, you can practice more English every day at Ovi English School online.\nWe have a free study guide for today's lesson. You can find the link in the description. It has vocabulary lists, exercises, and practice questions.  \n[NEWS STORY]\nT-Mobile is a big phone company in the United States. They are working on a new phone feature that will help people talk in different languages. This feature is called Live Translation. It uses something called AI, or artificial intelligence, to translate phone calls.  \n\nFirst, what does translate mean? It means to change words from one language to another. For example, from English to Spanish or from French to Chinese. T-Mobile’s new feature will translate phone calls live. This means that when you talk, the other person hears your words in their own language right away.  \n\nThis is very special because many people use different languages. Sometimes, they want to talk but cannot understand each other. T-Mobile wants to help with this problem. The new feature will work on many phones, even old flip phones. Flip phones are simple phones with buttons, not like smartphones.  \n\nThe company said this feature will work with more than 50 languages. That is a lot of languages! This means many people can use it to talk to friends, family, or work partners. The feature will start in a test version this spring. This is called a beta test. Some T-Mobile customers can try it first.  \n\nThe big idea is that the translation happens inside the phone network. This is important because people do not need to download a special app. An app is a program you put on your phone. With this, you only need to use your phone and the network to get translation.  \n\nThe CEO of T-Mobile, Srini Gopalan, said the hardest problem for many people is understanding each other. He wants to make talking easier and bring people closer together. He said this new feature will turn conversations into community. That means talking can help people feel connected.  \n\nWhy does this story matter? It shows how technology can help people in real life. Language is not a barrier anymore. People from different countries can talk easily and understand each other. This can help families, friends, and even businesses.  \n\nIn summary, T-Mobile will soon let people talk on the phone in many languages. The phone will translate words live, without extra apps. This is a big step for phone technology and for people who speak different languages.  \n[PRACTICE]\nQUESTION: What company is making the new live translation feature?  \nANSWER: T-Mobile is making the new live translation feature.  \n\nQUESTION: What does the live translation feature do?  \nANSWER: It translates phone calls into different languages live.  \n\nQUESTION: How many languages will the feature translate?  \nANSWER: It will translate more than 50 languages.  \n\nQUESTION: Do users need to download an app to use this feature?  \nANSWER: No, users do not need to download an app.  \n\nQUESTION: Why does the CEO say this feature is important?  \nANSWER: He says it helps people understand each other and feel connected.  \n[CLOSING]\nThe answer to our trivia question is that the new feature will translate live phone calls in more than 50 languages. Two interesting things from today’s story are that the feature works on old flip phones and it does not need an app. You can find more fun English stories and practice at Ovi English School online.
