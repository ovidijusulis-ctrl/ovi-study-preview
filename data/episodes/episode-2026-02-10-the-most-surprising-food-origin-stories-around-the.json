  "transcript": "OPENING  \nHello, friends! Welcome to Ovi English School. Today, we have a fun topic about food. We will talk about some surprising stories about famous foods from around the world. You will learn where these foods really come from. Here is a question for you: Which country is the real home of the pizza? Think about it. I will tell you the answer at the end of the episode. We have a free study site for today’s lesson. You can find the link in the description. There, you can read the story, learn new words, and practice your English. Let’s have fun and start!\n\nNEWS STORY  \nHave you ever thought about where your favorite food comes from? Some foods have very surprising stories. Today, I want to tell you about three famous foods and their interesting beginnings. These stories show us that food can be full of history and culture.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about pizza. Many people think pizza comes from Italy, and that is true. But the story is more interesting. Long ago, people in Naples, a city in Italy, made a special kind of bread with tomatoes, cheese, and herbs. They called this bread “pizza.” At that time, tomatoes were new in Europe. They came from America, but people did not know they were good to eat. Slowly, people in Naples started to use tomatoes on their bread. This made pizza very tasty. The most famous pizza is called “Margherita.” It has red tomatoes, white cheese, and green basil leaves. These colors are the same as the Italian flag. The pizza was named after Queen Margherita, who liked it very much. So, pizza is a food with a story about a queen and new ingredients from far away places.\n\nNext, let’s go to Japan and talk about sushi. Sushi is rice with fish or vegetables. Many people think sushi is raw fish, but that is not always true. The story of sushi is very old. In the past, people in Japan wanted to keep fish fresh. They put fish with rice and salt in a container. The rice helped keep the fish safe for a long time. After some time, people learned to eat the rice and fish together. This was the beginning of sushi. Today, sushi is very popular all over the world. But sushi started as a way to keep food fresh before refrigerators existed.\n\nNow, we travel to Mexico for our last story. Have you tried chocolate? Chocolate comes from the cacao tree. The ancient people of Mexico, like the Aztecs, loved chocolate. But they did not eat it as candy. They made a special drink with cacao beans, water, and spices. This drink was very important to them. They believed it gave them energy and strength. The Aztec emperor, Montezuma, drank lots of this chocolate drink every day. He thought it helped him be a good leader. Today, chocolate is sweet and popular everywhere. But it started as a strong and spicy drink for kings.\n\nThese stories show us that food is not just food. It has history, culture, and sometimes surprises. Pizza is from Italy but uses tomatoes from America. Sushi started as a way to keep fish fresh in Japan. Chocolate was a special drink for Aztec kings in Mexico. When you eat these foods, you can remember their exciting stories.\n\nFood connects us to different places and times. It is fun to learn about the history behind what we eat. Next time you enjoy pizza, sushi, or chocolate, think about their amazing journeys. Maybe you will want to learn more stories about your favorite foods!\n\nPractice  \nQUESTION: Where does pizza come from? Think about your answer.  \nANSWER: Pizza comes from Italy, especially the city of Naples. Did you get it right? Great job!\n\nQUESTION: What are the three colors on a Margherita pizza? Can you remember?  \nANSWER: The colors are red, white, and green. That is correct!\n\nQUESTION: How did sushi start in Japan? Think about your answer.  \nANSWER: Sushi started as a way to keep fish fresh using rice and salt. Well done if you remembered that!\n\nQUESTION: What kind of chocolate did the Aztecs drink? Think carefully.  \nANSWER: They drank a spicy and strong chocolate drink with water and spices. Good job!\n\nQUESTION: Why did the Aztec emperor Montezuma like the chocolate drink? Can you remember?  \nANSWER: He believed the chocolate drink gave him energy and strength to be a good leader. Excellent!\n\nCLOSING  \nRemember my question at the beginning? The answer is Italy. Pizza really comes from Italy, especially Naples. Did you guess correctly? Today, we learned that pizza has colors like the Italian flag and was named for a queen. Sushi started as a way to keep fish fresh in Japan, not just raw fish. And chocolate began as a special drink for Aztec kings in Mexico. If you want to practice more, visit our study site.
