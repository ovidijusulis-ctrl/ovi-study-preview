  "transcript": "[OPENING]\nWelcome listeners to Ovi English School. Today we travel far back in time. A small, ancient animal may have changed dinner forever. Here is one trivia question: how long ago did this creature live? I will tell you the answer at the end. Visit our study site today for a quick, free quiz.\nWe have a free study guide for today's lesson. You can find the link in the description. It has vocabulary lists, exercises, and practice questions.\n[NEWS STORY]\nFirst, picture a little creature on the ground. It is about the size of a football. It lived very long ago, 307 million years ago. Scientists think it ate plants. Then, this animal got a fun name. People call it Heberti’s tyrant digger. The name sounds big and strong. But the body was small and compact.\n\nAfter that, the experts looked closely at its teeth. The teeth were not sharp like a wolf. They were flat and strong, like small grinders. They looked perfect for chewing tough veggies. In many places, people say football and mean soccer. In the United States, football is a long, brown ball. Both balls fit in two hands. This animal was about that size in life.\n\nNext, the team made a new study. They checked shapes on the teeth. They saw forms made to crush and grind plants. So they think it ate leaves, stems, and seeds. A quick word for two ideas. A fossil is old life turned into rock. A vertebrate is an animal with a backbone. This little fossil vertebrate walked on land. That makes it special in history.\n\nImagine an ancient forest with tall ferns. The ground is wet and soft. The air is warm. Our small friend walks slowly and eats. Then, think about its name again. Heberti’s tyrant digger sounds like a boss. It also sounds like it liked to dig in soil. The name hints at digging, but we are not sure.\n\nAfter that, the story gets larger. Long ago, most land animals ate meat or bugs. Plant eating on land was new. This creature may be one of the first to try it. Why does this matter? Plant eaters change the whole food web. They open new paths for life. Later animals can grow bigger and live in new ways. It all starts with simple, tough plants.\n\nScientists like to repeat key ideas. The teeth were made for grinding plants. The body was about football size. It lived 307 million years ago. It may be one of the first plant eaters on land. Finally, the study helps us imagine the past. We see a small, brave eater of greens. It takes a bite and crushes a leaf. And a new chapter in life begins.\n[PRACTICE]\nQUESTION: What is the creature’s nickname in the story?\nANSWER: The creature’s nickname is Heberti’s tyrant digger.\nQUESTION: How big was this ancient animal?\nANSWER: It was about the size of a football you can hold.\nQUESTION: When did it live on Earth?\nANSWER: It lived about 307 million years ago.\nQUESTION: What did its teeth seem designed to do?\nANSWER: Its teeth seemed designed to grind and crush tough plants.\nQUESTION: Why is this discovery important?\nANSWER: It is important because it shows early plant eating on land.\n[CLOSING]\nHere is the trivia answer: it lived about 307 million years ago. Today, we learned that Heberti’s tyrant digger was football-sized, and its teeth were made for grinding tough plants. Try our short review lesson on the study site now. Thank you for learning with Ovi English School. Have a great day, and goodbye.\nIf you want to practice more, check the study guide. The link is in the description below.
