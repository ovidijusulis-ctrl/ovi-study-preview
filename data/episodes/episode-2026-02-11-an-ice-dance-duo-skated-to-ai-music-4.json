  "transcript": "[OPENING]\nHello, friends! Welcome to Ovi English School. Today, I have a fun story about ice dancing and music made by a computer. Did you know that some music at the Olympics was made by a machine, not a person? Here is a question for you: What problem did the ice dancers have with the music? I will tell you the answer at the end. If you want to learn more English, visit our website at ovi-english.com.\nWe have a free study guide for today's lesson. You can find the link in the description. It has vocabulary lists, exercises, and practice questions.  \n[NEWS STORY]\nAt the recent Winter Olympics, two ice dancers from the Czech Republic did something very new. Their names are Katerina Mrazkova and Daniel Mrazek. They performed their dance to music made by something called artificial intelligence, or AI for short. AI means a computer that can do smart things, like make music.  \n\nFirst, this was exciting because usually, dancers use music made by people, like composers or bands. But Katerina and Daniel wanted to try something different. They asked a computer to create their music. The computer made a special song just for their ice dance.  \n\nThen, when they skated, many people liked the music. It was new and interesting. The music fit their moves on the ice. The ice dancing was beautiful to watch, and the music helped tell a story with their dance.  \n\nBut after the Olympics, something surprising happened. Some people found out that the AI music was not completely original. The computer used parts of other songs without permission. This is called plagiarism. Plagiarism means copying someone else’s work and saying it is yours.  \n\nKaterina and Daniel did not know this before their show. They only wanted to try new technology. Now, they are learning that AI does not always follow the rules. Sometimes, it can copy music without telling you. This can cause problems for the dancers and the people who made the original songs.  \n\nThis story is important because it shows how fast technology is changing art and sports. Using AI can be fun and new, but it can also cause mistakes. We need to be careful when using computers to make music or art.  \n\nFinally, Katerina and Daniel will keep skating and making new dances. They hope to use music that is fair and original next time. Their story teaches us about trying new things and learning from mistakes.  \n\nRepeat Two Czech ice dancers used AI music at the Olympics. The music was exciting but had a problem. The AI copied parts of other songs. This is plagiarism. The dancers did not want to do this, but it happened anyway.  \n[PRACTICE]\nQUESTION: Who are the two ice dancers from the Czech Republic?  \nANSWER: The two ice dancers are Katerina Mrazkova and Daniel Mrazek.  \n\nQUESTION: What kind of music did they use for their ice dance?  \nANSWER: They used music made by artificial intelligence, or AI.  \n\nQUESTION: What is plagiarism?  \nANSWER: Plagiarism is copying someone else’s work and saying it is yours.  \n\nQUESTION: Why did the dancers have a problem with the AI music?  \nANSWER: The AI music copied parts of other songs without permission.  \n\nQUESTION: What can we learn from this story?  \nANSWER: We can learn that using new technology can be fun but also needs care and rules.  \n[CLOSING]\nThe answer to the trivia question is that the ice dancers had a problem because the AI music copied other songs, which is called plagiarism. Today, we learned about two Czech ice dancers who used AI music at the Olympics and how this caused a surprise. We also learned why it is important to be careful with new technology.
