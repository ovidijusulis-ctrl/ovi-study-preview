  "summary": "Sleeper laptop. | Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge Business laptops are typically dull computers foisted on employees en masse. But higher-end enterprise workstation notebooks sometimes get an interesting enough blend of power and features to appeal to enthusiasts. HP's ZBook Ultra G1a is a nice example. It's easy to see it as another gray boring-book for spendy business types, until you notice a few key specs: an AMD Strix Halo APU, lots of RAM, an OLED display, and an adequate amount of speedy ports (Thunderbolt 4, even - a rarity on AMD laptops). I know from my time with the Asus ROG Flow Z13 and Framework Desktop that anything using AMD's high-end Ryzen AI Max chips should make for a co … Read the full story at The Verge.",

  "transcript": "[OPENING]\nWelcome listeners to Ovi English School.\nToday we meet a quiet laptop with a wild heart. It looks simple, but it can surprise you. The news is about the HP ZBook Ultra G1a, a business laptop with power. Trivia question: which rare port does this laptop include? I will reveal it at the end.\nVisit our study site for extra practice after the show.\nWe have a free study guide for today's lesson. You can find the link in the description. It has vocabulary lists, exercises, and practice questions.\n[NEWS STORY]\nFirst, let’s talk about business laptops. Many office workers get them from their companies. These laptops are often gray and plain. They do the job, but they are not fun. Then comes a new one with a secret. It is the HP ZBook Ultra G1a. At first glance, it looks like a normal office computer. But inside, it is strong and fast.\n\nIn English, we call this a sleeper. A sleeper looks quiet, but it moves fast. Like a car that looks slow, but wins the race. This laptop is a sleeper laptop. A reviewer from The Verge tested it. His name is Antonio G. Di Benedetto. The Verge is a popular technology news site in the United States. They write simple reviews for many new gadgets.\n\nNow, what is special inside? The ZBook Ultra G1a uses an AMD Strix Halo APU. An APU is one chip with the brain and the graphics together. This chip is part of AMD’s high-end Ryzen AI line. It brings strong power and smart AI features in one place. It also has lots of RAM, or memory. That means many apps can stay open. You can switch tasks without slowdowns. Work feels smooth, even with big files.\n\nThe screen is an OLED display. Colors look rich and deep on OLED. Black areas look truly black, not gray. It is great for movies, photos, and design. After that, we see the ports. Ports are the holes for cables and drives. This laptop even has Thunderbolt 4. Thunderbolt 4 is a very fast port for data and screens.\n\nWhy is that special here? Thunderbolt 4 is rare on AMD laptops. Many AMD laptops do not offer it. So this one is different. It lets you connect fast drives and big monitors easily. The reviewer also said, it has game. In English, that means it plays games well. It is not a huge gaming beast. But it can handle many popular games.\n\nYou can imagine your day with it. In the morning, you write emails and reports. At lunch, you join video calls. After work, you relax with a game. Maybe you play a friendly match with a friend. The laptop stays cool and steady. The OLED screen makes colors bright. It feels like two laptops in one.\n\nThe writer knew other AMD machines too. He tried the Asus ROG Flow Z13 before. He used a Framework Desktop with AMD chips as well. From that, he expected strong results. So, this ZBook looks boring, but it is not. It is a sleeper with power inside. It is a business machine that can also play. It breaks the old idea that office means dull.\n\nThis story matters because it shows choice. We can work hard and still have fun. One tool can do both jobs. That is good for many people. Finally, remember the key points. The HP ZBook Ultra G1a has an AMD Strix Halo APU. It includes lots of memory and an OLED screen. And yes, it carries rare Thunderbolt 4, even with AMD.\n[PRACTICE]\nQUESTION: What is the name of the laptop in the story?\nANSWER: The laptop is called the HP ZBook Ultra G1a.\n\nQUESTION: Who reviewed the laptop, and for which website?\nANSWER: Antonio G. Di Benedetto reviewed it for The Verge.\n\nQUESTION: What does the word sleeper mean in this story?\nANSWER: In this story, sleeper means it looks simple but is very powerful.\n\nQUESTION: Why is Thunderbolt 4 special on this laptop?\nANSWER: Thunderbolt 4 is special because it is rare on AMD laptops.\n\nQUESTION: How can this laptop fit both work and play?\nANSWER: It handles office tasks by day and can play many games after work.\n[CLOSING]\nHere is the trivia answer: the laptop includes the rare Thunderbolt 4 port. Today’s two coolest things were the sleeper idea, and the bright OLED screen with rich colors. Try the short quiz on our study site today. Thank you for learning with Ovi English School.
