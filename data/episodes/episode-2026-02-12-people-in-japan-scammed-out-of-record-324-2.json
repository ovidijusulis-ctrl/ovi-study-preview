  "transcript": "[OPENING]\nHello and welcome to our English learning podcast. Today, we have a story that is serious but important, and it can help you stay safe online. We will talk about a record amount of money lost to scams in Japan in 2025. As you listen, try to notice useful phrases and simple structures you can use in daily life. Take a deep breath, stay curious, and let’s begin.\nWe have a free study guide for today's lesson. You can find the link in the description. It has vocabulary lists, exercises, and practice questions.\n[NEWS STORY]\nIn 2025, people in Japan lost a record 324.11 billion yen to scams. That is about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars. Most of the money was taken through investment scams and romance scams that started on social media. These crimes were not rare, and they did not only affect the very old or the very young. In fact, scammers targeted all kinds of people, from students to office workers to small business owners.\n\nLet’s start with investment scams. In many cases, a stranger sent a friendly message online and said there was a new way to make fast, easy money. They talked about special trading systems or private deals. Sometimes they showed fake charts with rising lines or screenshots of “profits.” At first, they asked for a small amount, and the person could see a fake profit number on a website or app. So the person felt safe, and then sent more and more money. There is a saying, “too good to be true.” It means an offer sounds amazing but is not real. Investment scammers use exactly that kind of promise.\n\nRomance scams worked in a different way, but the goal was the same: to get money. A scammer created a nice profile with a friendly smile and some shared hobbies. They wrote long messages every day, and they seemed to care a lot. After building trust for weeks or months, they shared a sad story or an urgent problem. For example, they might say they need money for a medical bill, a flight ticket, or a customs fee. Because feelings were involved, many people wanted to help. The scammer used emotion and pressure to make the person act fast.\n\nSocial media and messaging apps made these scams easier. Scammers could copy photos, use fake names, and join groups about sports, travel, or finance. They tried to move the chat to a private app where it is harder to report them. Here is a useful phrase: “red flags.” Red flags are warning signs that tell you something is wrong. In this story, red flags include secret payments, pressure to keep the talk private, and promises of quick, guaranteed profit. Another phrase is “play it safe,” which means to be careful and not take a big risk.\n\nLosing money in a scam can change a person’s life. Some people lost their savings for school or for a home. Others even took loans because they believed they would double their money soon. When the truth came out, the website or the contact disappeared, and the pain was not only about money. People felt shame, stress, and even fear. Their families worried, and some relationships were damaged. It is heavy news, but it is also a chance to learn and support each other.\n\nAuthorities and companies in Japan are working to fight these problems. There are more public warnings that explain common tricks and show how to report suspicious messages. Banks and payment services are adding extra checks, especially for first-time transfers to new accounts. Some online platforms are removing fake profiles and reminding users to be careful. These steps help, but scammers are quick to change their methods. That is why public awareness is so important.\n\nSo, how can you protect yourself? First, slow down. Urgency is the scammer’s best friend. If someone says you must act right now, that is a red flag. Second, check details. Search the person’s name or the company name plus the word “scam.” Look carefully at web addresses, and see if reviews look real or copy-pasted. Third, do not send money or gifts to someone you only met online. Real companies do not ask for payment by gift cards or secret codes. There is another helpful phrase: “sleep on it.” It means you wait until the next day before making a big decision. Talk with a friend, a family member, or your bank. A second opinion can save you a lot of money and pain.\n\nWhy do these scams work so well? They use two strong forces: hope and fear. Investment scams use hope for a better future and a sense of missing out. Romance scams use the human need for connection and trust. When you mix those feelings with time pressure, clear thinking is difficult. Remember, being scammed does not mean you are foolish. It means someone lied to you in a very skilled way. Sharing your story, reporting the scam, and asking for help are brave steps. In the end, knowledge is power. The more we learn, the safer we can be online and offline.\n[PRACTICE]\nQUESTION: How much money did people in Japan lose to scams in 2025, and which types were most common?\nANSWER: They lost a record 324.11 billion yen, about 2.1 billion dollars, mostly through investment scams and romance scams on social media.\n\nQUESTION: What does the phrase “too good to be true” mean in this episode?\nANSWER: It means an offer sounds amazing and easy, but it is not real and should not be trusted.\n\nQUESTION: How do romance scammers build trust before asking for money?\nANSWER: They chat often, share friendly messages, pretend to have similar interests, and then tell an urgent personal story to create pressure.\n\nQUESTION: What are two red flags mentioned in the story?\nANSWER: Pressure to act fast and move the chat to a private app, and requests for secret or unusual payments with promises of guaranteed profit.\n\nQUESTION: What are two simple steps you can take to protect yourself?\nANSWER: Slow down and “sleep on it,” and ask a friend or your bank for a second opinion before sending any money.\n[CLOSING]\nGreat job today.
