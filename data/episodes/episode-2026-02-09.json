That means he is British. Aden is a coach. A coach is a person who helps a sports team play better. He is the defensive coordinator for a team called the Seattle Seahawks. Defensive coordinator means he helps the team stop the other team from scoring points. The Seattle Seahawks are a football team in the United States.  \n\nNow, you might wonder, what is the Super Bowl? The Super Bowl is the biggest American football game of the year. It is like a final game where two teams play to see who is the best. Many people watch the Super Bowl on TV. It is a very big event in the USA. This year, the Super Bowl was number 60, so people call it Super Bowl 60. It happened at a place called Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. California is a state on the west coast of America.  \n\nIn this Super Bowl 60, Aden’s team, the Seattle Seahawks, played against another team called the New England Patriots. The Patriots are a very famous team. They have won many Super Bowls before. But this time, the Seattle Seahawks won the game. The final score was 29 to 13. That means the Seahawks scored 29 points, and the Patriots scored 13 points. The Seahawks won by a lot!  \n\nAden Durde said, “There is no better feeling.” He means that winning the Super Bowl feels amazing. It is the best feeling in the world. Aden worked very hard with his players all year. Now, they are champions. A champion is a winner.  \n\nThis win is very special for Aden. He is British, but he works in American football. It is not easy to do that. American football is very popular in the United States, but not so much in Britain. So Aden’s success is big news for British people who love sports.  \n\nThe Seattle Seahawks played very well in the game. Their defense was strong. Defense means stopping the other team from scoring. Aden helped the players know how to stop the Patriots. The Patriots tried hard, but they could not win.  \n\nThe Super Bowl is more than just a game. It is a big party for many people. There is music, food, and famous singers. People watch the game with friends and family. It is a fun day for many people in America.  \n\nAden said the feeling of winning the Super Bowl is like no other feeling. It makes him very happy and proud. He said it is a dream come true. That means something he wanted for a long time has happened.  \n\nThe Seahawks and Aden Durde worked as a team. Teamwork is very important in sports. Everyone has a job, and they help each other. That is how they won the big game.  \n\nSo, to remember: Aden Durde is a British coach. He is the defensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks won Super Bowl 60. They beat the New England Patriots 29 to 13. Aden says winning feels amazing. This story shows us that hard work and teamwork can help us reach big goals.  \n[PRACTICE]\nQUESTION: Who is Aden Durde?
