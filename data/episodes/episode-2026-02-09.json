  "summary": "Goldfield Historic High School is an abandoned schoolhouse located in what was once the largest town in Nevada that illustrates the boom-and-bust cycle seen in mining towns across the American West. It was constructed in mere months in 1907 as one of four local schools built in less than two years—but by 1918 it was the only one still in operation.\n\r\nGoldfield, Nevada’s history started in 1902 when Tom Fisherman discovered (you guessed it!) gold in the area. Fisherman, who was Native American, showed his gold samples to prospectors Henry Stimler and Billy Marsh, who traveled the 26-ish miles south from Tonopah to the site of his discovery to investigate. They struck gold on Columbia Mountain, and in the spring of 1903, other prospectors started flocking to the area that would soon be known as Goldfield. And the growing town needed infrastructure, including several schools.\n\r\nWhen Goldfield High School first opened in 1908, the three-story building housed 25 faculty and 125 students across a dozen classrooms and a large auditorium—with a total seating capacity of 450. Its façade, designed by architect J.B. Randall, featured an arched entryway, a wide staircase, and an elaborate wrought-iron gate that has since gone mysteriously missing.\n\r\nThe finished schoolhouse was a fitting showcase for Goldfield’s newfound wealth, costing $100,000—or the equivalent of $3.5 million in 2026. But the gold rush didn’t last. Just a decade later, in 1918, the town’s population had dwindled so much that every other school closed, consolidating all grades into the high school building. In 1953, the school building was fully decommissioned.\n\r\nIn 2008, the Goldfield Historical Society started a major restoration project to bring the school back to its former glory. To date, major milestones in the project include repairs to the stonework façade, a front staircase rebuild, new windows, a new roof, and classroom restorations.\n\r\nFor visitors interested in taking a look inside, tours are available by appointment.",

  "transcript": "[OPENING]\nHello, friends! Welcome to Ovi English School. Today, we have a cool story about a very old school in a small town called Goldfield in Nevada, USA. This school is special because it shows us how a town can grow fast and then become quiet again. Here is a question for you: What precious metal was found in Goldfield that made the town grow quickly? Think about it. I will give you the answer at the end of the episode. We have a free study site for today's lesson. You can find the link in the description. You can read the story, learn new words, and practice. Let’s get started!\nWe have a free study guide for today's lesson. You can find the link in the description. It has vocabulary lists, exercises, and practice questions.\n[NEWS STORY]\nA long time ago, in 1902, a man named Tom Fisherman found gold in a place called Goldfield, Nevada. Gold is a shiny, yellow metal that is very valuable. Tom Fisherman was a Native American man. He showed pieces of gold to two other men, Henry Stimler and Billy Marsh. These men were prospectors. Prospectors are people who look for gold or other valuable things in the ground.\n\nHenry and Billy traveled about 26 miles from a town called Tonopah to see the gold. They found gold on a mountain called Columbia Mountain. In spring 1903, many other prospectors came to Goldfield because they wanted to find gold too. The town grew very fast. When a town grows quickly like this, it is called a boom. Goldfield was the biggest town in Nevada for a short time.\n\nBecause the town grew fast, people needed many things. They needed houses, shops, and schools. Schools are important because children need to learn. So, in just a few months in 1907, the people built four schools in Goldfield. One of these schools was Goldfield High School. A high school is for older children, usually from about 14 to 18 years old.\n\nGoldfield High School opened in 1908. It had three floors and many rooms. There were 12 classrooms, a big auditorium, and space for 125 students and 25 teachers. An auditorium is a big room where people can meet or watch shows. The school was very beautiful. The front had a big arched doorway, a wide staircase, and a special gate made of iron. The gate is missing now, but it was very fancy.\n\nThe school cost $100,000 to build. That was a lot of money in 1907. If we think about today’s money, it would be about 3.5 million dollars! This shows how rich the town was because of the gold. The school was a symbol of the town’s wealth. Wealth means having a lot of money or valuable things.\n\nBut the good time did not last long. After about ten years, many people left Goldfield because the gold was not easy to find anymore. When people leave a town like this, it is called a bust. By 1918, only one school was left open. All the children went to Goldfield High School. The other schools closed because there were not enough students.\n\nThe school stayed open until 1953. Then it closed completely. For many years, the school was empty. It became an old, abandoned building. Abandoned means no one uses it anymore. But the building is important because it tells the story of Goldfield’s boom and bust.\n\nIn 2008, a group called the Goldfield Historical Society started to fix the school. A historical society is a group of people who want to save old buildings and stories. They worked hard to repair the stone front of the building, rebuild the stairs, put in new windows, and fix the roof. They also fixed the classrooms inside.\n\nNow, people can visit the school if they make an appointment. This means they must call or write before they come. The school is like a museum. A museum is a place where people go to see things from the past.\n\nGoldfield High School shows us a story of hope and change. It reminds us how a town can grow very fast because of gold, and then become quiet again when the gold is gone. The school is a beautiful old building with many stories inside its walls.\n\nRepeat key facts Remember, Goldfield grew fast after gold was found in 1902. The high school opened in 1908 and was the last school open by 1918. It closed in 1953 but is now being fixed so visitors can see it.\n[PRACTICE]\nQUESTION: Who found gold in Goldfield in 1902? Think about your answer.\nANSWER: Tom Fisherman found gold in Goldfield in 1902. Did you get it right? Great job!\n\nQUESTION: How many schools were built in Goldfield in less than two years? Think about your answer.\nANSWER: Four schools were built in Goldfield in less than two years. That is correct!\n\nQUESTION: What special features did Goldfield High School have at the front? Can you remember?\nANSWER: It had an arched entryway, a wide staircase, and a wrought-iron gate. Well done!\n\nQUESTION: Why did the other schools close by 1918? Think carefully.\nANSWER: The other schools closed because the town’s population became smaller and there were not enough students. Great answer!\n\nQUESTION: What group started fixing the school in 2008? Think about your answer.\nANSWER: The Goldfield Historical Society started fixing the school in 2008. Excellent!\n[CLOSING]\nRemember my question at the beginning? The answer is gold. Did you guess correctly? Today, we learned about Goldfield, Nevada, and how gold made the town grow fast.
